0"IMPLY gate does not have its own letter notation in this simulation, instead"
0"it can be made with an OR gate with the a input inverted. The inverted input"
0"is denoted with a little circle in this simulation, for once like real"
0"electronics notation actually does it. Real electronics also uses an OR gate"
0"with inverted input as notation for IMPLY, and also uses a little circle at"
0"the input to invert inputs. (note: ensure the render mode is 'graphical' to"
0"see the little circle, in text mode you see a square bracket ']' instead)."
0"Note that this gate is less common compared to the others and is really more"

registerCircuit('Binary Numbers Tutorial', `

0"In logic circuits, we use binary instead of decimal counting. Decimal uses"
0"ten different digits. Binary uses a similar counting system, but with only 2"
0"digits: 0 and 1. This is because in electronic circuits, it is much simpler"
0"to make a switch with two states than with ten states. Computers typically do"
0"all math and other operations with binary numbers, and only convert the"
0"results to decimal when presenting them to the user."

0"So to be prepared for math circuits coming up later, this is an introduction"
0"to binary numbers and binary counting"

0"Decimal counts up with 10 possible symbols, from 0 to 0. Whenever 9 is"
0"reached, a next digit is incremented (if that next digit is a hidden zero,"
0"since prefix zeroes are usually not shown, it becomes a 1 and thus visible)"
0"With binary, it's just the same, except there are only two possible values,"
0"so next bits get added much faster"

0"Here are the first few decimal and binary numbers:"

3"decimal | binary"
3"--------+-------"
3"      0 |      0"
3"      1 |      1"

0"Prefix zeroes of a binary number are often shown. For example when one speaks"
0"of an 8-bit binary number, all 8 bits are shown, even zeroes in front. E.g."
0"the number 1 as an 8-bit number is:"

"00000001"

0"To input and output binary numbers, set bits to 1 such that the sum of their"
0"values is the number you want. The value of each bit is a power of two. The"
0"least significant bit has value 1. The more significant bits have higher"
0"powers of two, for example 2 for the second bit, 4 for the third bit, 8 for"
0"the fourth bit, etc..."

0"Form any number you want below. For example, to form the number hundred, set"
0"the bits with values 64, 32 and 4 to 1. The sum of those is 100, and that is"
0"the only possible way to form the number 100. Note that the circuit below"
0"does not actually do anything, it just allows you to toggle some switches and"
0"LEDs to try to form numbers. The sum of all values below is 255 so that is"
0"the highest number you can make, it is the highest unsigned 8-bit value."

0"above, except some processing with logic gates will happen in-between"

0"We can also add a built-in binary-to-decimal display to switches to allow you"
0"to experiment more easily with binary numbers. The display shows your binary"
0"number in decimal. Try to make '21' for example. You can make all numbers"

0"Flip-flops serve as memory elements, or elements that can keep state,"
0"in electronic circuits. This tutorial interactively introduces flip-flops"

0"# Flip-Flop Types"

0"Flip flop types can be broken down into their logic behavior, and their"
0"clock behavior. Logic behavior is discussed here, clock behavior (latch vs"
0"flip-flop) in the next chapter."

0"There are 4 main flip-flop types: SR, D, T and JK. Before looking at how they"
0"work at logic-gate level, let's first use the prebuilt components that this"
0"simulation provides to look at their behavior."

0"All of these types have a clock input C. This clock is edge-triggered, that"
0"is, only at that exact instant where it goes on, it will update its state. At"
0"any other time, while the clock is high or low, it will remember that state."

0"## SR Flip-Flop"

0"The SR flip-flop set-reset flip-flop has two inputs: S and R. Whenever the"
0"clock is edge-triggered, the output will go on if S is enabled, of is R is"
0"enabled, or stay as-is if neither S nor R are enabled. Having both S and R"
0"enabled is considered an invalid combination, and whichever behavior it"
0"happens to show here does not matter as it is unspecified and may violate"
0"assumptions"

 "S"s..>j#q..>l"Q"
        ###
 "R"s..>k##
        ###
 "C"s..>c##

0"The truth table of the SR flip-flop is as follows. It shows the transition"
0"(if any) that happens at each clock cycle: What is the next Q depending on"
0"the D input and the current Q"

3"+---+---+-------+"
3"| S | R | Qnext |"
3"+---+---+-------+"
3"| 0 | 0 |   Q   |"
3"| 0 | 1 |   1   |"
3"| 1 | 0 |   0   |"
3"| 1 | 1 |invalid|"
3"+---+---+-------+"

0"## D Flip-Flop"

0"The D flip-flop or data flip-flop will remember the state of its D input line"
0"whenever the clock goes from low to high. The clock is edge-triggered, that"
0"is, only at that exact instant where it goes on, it will update its state."
0"Try it out: The way to get the output enabled, is to first enable d, then"
0"turn the clock c from off to on."

 "D"s..>d#q..>l"Q"
        ###
 "C"s..>c##

0"The truth table of the D flip-flop is as follows. It shows the transition (if"
0"any) that happens at each clock cycle: What is the next Q depending on the D"
0"input and the current Q"

3"+---+-------+"
3"| D | Qnext |"
3"+---+-------+"
3"| 0 |   0   |"
3"| 1 |   1   |"
3"+---+-------+"

0"It looks as if the truth table shows that the state is just equal to the"
0"input D, so it would seem as if it doesn't do much interesting? But, it"
0"remembers the state while the clock is off. A D flip-flop delays the input"
0"by 1 clock cycle. By looping its output back to the input with a"
0"multiplexer, this is a very useful component for registers in CPU's"

0"## T Flip-Flop"

0"The T flip-flop or toggle flip-flop will toggle its state whenever the T"
0"input is enabled and the clock is triggered. If T is off, it will. keep its"
0"state when the clock triggers."

 "T"s..>t#q..>l"Q"

3"| 0 |   Q   |"
3"| 1 |   Q'  |"
3"+---+-------+"

0"## JK Flip-Flop"

0"The JK flip-flop is similar to the SR input, the J input behaves like set and"
0"the k input like reset. But for the JK flip-flop, the combination of having"
0"both j and k inputs enabled also has well defined behavior: it toggles the"
0"output similar to a T flip-flop in that case."

3"| 1 | 0 |   0   |"
3"| 1 | 1 |   Q'  |"
3"+---+---+-------+"

0"The JK flip-flop is universal, it can easily be configured to act as SR, D or"
0"T flip-flop: T by connecting J and K together, D by making K the inverse of"
0"J."

0"In practice, many flip-flops also come with an asynchronous reset input"
0"(clear), and somtimes such asynchronous set input (preset), and often also an"
0"inverted version of the output. Asynchronous means it ignores the clock and"
0"overrides everything."

0"# Latches vs Flip-Flops"

0"In addition to the 4 types above, there are also 3 ways the timing works."
0"All of the above were the most advanced type, flip-flops. More primitive"
0"devices with less gates can work as a latch or as a gated latch. The"
0"different levels are:"

0"- Latch: operates immediately, asynchronously, at the lowest level,"
0"  the inputs directly affect the outputs (transparent). Does not have"
0"  a clock or enable input, so one less input than the next types."
0"- Gated Latch: latch with an enable input 'E'. When the enable input is high,"
0"  it still works like a latch, when low, it keeps the current state and"
0"  ignores the other inputs. The enable input is not a true clock yet and is"
0"  not edge-triggered."
0"- Flip-Flop: when it has an edge-triggered clock 'C', for the most reliable"
0"  well-controlled behavior"

0"The latches will come up more in the next tutorials where we build flip-flops"
0"from primitive components, because latches are the basic primitive to build"
0"the more advanced types from."

0"Combining these 3 types with the 4 types above gives 12 types of devices,"
0"although not all make sense:"
0"- a T or JK flip-flop can only work with an edge-triggered clock, otherwise"
0"  they would toggle chaotically in the toggle state"
0"- a D latch would be nothing more than a delay"

0"This table summarizes all those combinations:"

3"+-----+----------+----------------+--------------+"

0"This concludes the first flip-flop tutorial, this explains how to use them"
0"in designs."

0"This tutorial was only a first introduction describing what they do and used"
0"the built-in flip-flop functionality rather than making them from more"
0"primitive components."

0"The next tutorial shows how to build flip-flops from logic gates, and shows"

0"# Flip-flops from logic gates"

0"See the previous tutorial for the explanation what flip-flops do and what"
0"types exist."

0"Now let's make flip-flops from actual logic gates, rather than using the"
0"idealized simulated devices. This section will look at the low level timings"
0"in the gates, so make sure the update algorithm is set to 'electron' mode"

0"We will actually build up from latches towards true edge-triggered"
0"flip-flops. This because a latch is much simpler to make from gates, and the"
0"edge triggered ones require more advanced circuits."

0"## SR NOR Latch"

0"The most basic flip-flop circuit in electronics has two looped-back"
0"NOR gates, and can flip between two states - and remember them."

0"It's called the SR NOR latch today, but originally was called flip-flop"
0"for its behavior. Naming this latch 'flip-flop' is no longer valid today,"
0"see the previous tutorial for the distinction between a latch (which is"
0"asynchronous) and flip-flop (which has an edge-triggered clock input)."

0"It remembers the state of the last switch that was enabled, when both"
0"switches are off. There is also an invalid state: both switches on is"
0"invalid, it happens to make both outputs go off for this particular"
0"combination of gates, but this breaks the desired mode of operation"
0"where exactly one of the two outputs is on and the other is its inverse."

 "S"s..>O<.>l"Q  on"
        . .
         x
        . .
 "R"s..>O<.>l"Q' off"

0"Please carefully notice the wiring above: For convenience the LEDs are"
0"connected to the opposite NOR gate so that the position matches the"
0"corresponding switch. This same NOR latch will be reused many times below,"
0"until a chapter about NAND logic much later."

0"A bit more compact representation of the same thing:"

 "S"s...>O<...>l "Q"
         v .
 "R"s...>O..

0"This latch can also be made from NAND gates instead of NOR gates, but the"
0"inputs are then active-low."


0"## Gated SR Latch"

0"An SR latch can be made 'gated' by adding an 'enable' input. Only when the"
0"enable input is enabled, will the inputs have any effect. This allows to"
0"control more easily when the state of the flip-flop should update, even if"
0"the input signals are doing other things while enable is off. This can be"
0"done by adding AND gates in front:"

 "S"s..>a>O<.>l"Q  on"
        ^ . .
 "E"s....  x
        v . .
 "R"s..>a>O<.>l"Q' off"

0"## Gated D Latch"

0"A non-gated D-latch would not be too interesting, as it would simply"
0"immediately output the same value as it input. Making it gates allows it to"
0"remember the state while enable is off. A gated SR latch can easily be"
0"modified into a gated D-latch: Connect the D input to S when on, to R when"
0"off:"

 "D"s....>a>O<.>l"Q  on"
        . ^ . .
 "E"s...+..  x
        . v . .
        .]a>O<.>l"Q' off"


0"## JK and T Latch"

0"Neither a T-latch nor a JK-latch make too much sense, the toggling only works"
0"in stable ways with an edge-triggered clock input, without it the signal"
0"would pulse rapidly and it would be quite random which state it is in when"
0"disabling the enable input. So those only make sense as flip-flops, see above"
0"as well as further below. Here's a JK latch anyway:"


         ...
         v .
"J" s...>a>O<...>l
           v .
"K" s...>a>O..
         ^ .
         ...

0"How the latch works: the right two NORs are an SR latch as seen above. The"
0"two inputs are AND-ed with the output of their corresponding NOR (they could"
0"alternatively be AND-ed with the inverse of the output of the opposite NOR),"
0"so the switch input will be seen by the NOR but then immediately disable"
0"itself due to the NORs output going off. The NOR keeps its state thanks to"
0"the opposite NOR though. But now if both switches are active, this causes an"
0"eternal conflict between both NORs, causing the blinking."

0"It can also be made from 4 NOR gates instead of NAND gates, but"
0"the inputs are then active-low."

0"A T latch can be made by tying J and K together:"

         ...
         v .
"T" s...>a>O<...>l"Q"
       .   v .
       .>a>O..
         ^ .
         ...

0"The toggling makes the output LED blink rapidly. So this toggling"
0"is not very useful as it's pretty random which state it will be in when"
0"releasing an input, especially given that in real life electronics this"
0"happens at nanosecond speed."

0"## gated JK and T Latch"

0"These latches, too, can be gated. However, the toggle output still"
0"does not get more useful from this because the gate is not edge-triggered."
0"Note the 3-input AND gates."

0"# Attempting edge-triggered clocks"

0"How to make an edge-triggered clock? A simple way to try first, but that"
0"will turn out to be not optimal, is to turn the clock signal into a very"
0"short pulse, with an edge-detecter circuit like this:"

s....>d..]a..>l
    .     ^
    .......

0"There is a small delay included in the above, and an AND gate with one"
0"inverted input, so that it only outputs a short pulse when you just enable"
0"the switch. Using this as enable gate of a gated SR or D latch makes them"
0"behave more like an edge triggered flip-flop"

0"A delay of 2 happens to work in this simulation because the paths in the"
0"flip-flops are 2 ticks long (that is, in these NOR NOR latches, the longest"
0"path goes through both NORs, which is 2 ticks), and the 2 at the delay"
0"happens to make it match those 2 ticks perfectly here"

0"But that is always going to be fiddly. How much delay do you need in high"
0"speed circuits to be optimally fast yet not too fast for it to? fail? In real"
0"life, especially for the toggling state of T and JK flip-flops, it is very"
0"hard to get this right"

0"# Truly edge-triggered clocks"

0"A more optimal edge-triggered clock, that does not rely on exact timing of a"
0"short pulse, can be made by putting two gated D latches in a row, the"
0"receiving the inverted enable (clock) signal, the second the regular enable"
0"(clock) signal and with the output of the previous one as input. Then while"
0"the clock is low, your input can freely change the first one but not the"
0"second one that gives the actual output. When the clock is high, then the"
0"first one no longer responds to the input, but the second one will update its"
0"state to that of the first one. As long as the clock remains high, the first"
0"one cannot change, so after this update when the clock went high nothing can"
0"affect the second one anymore either. That's how to get the perfect positive"
0"edge-triggered effect. This is also called the 'master-slave' flip-flop."
0"(note: you could also avoid the invertor at an input of the second flip-flop"
0"by using the inverted output from the first flip-flop)"

0"In the above circuit, moving the position where the invertor of the clock is"
0"can make it negative edge-triggered instead of positive edge-triggered"

0"Similarly, using two gated JK latches can create a JK flip-flop in such"
0"configuration, so that we get a useful toggle signal. Rather than two"
0"independent JK latches, the output from the second one is fed back to the"
0"first. If you enable both J and K, it will toggle state every time the clock"
0"is positively edge triggered. Though this is not yet an actual perfect"
0"edge-triggered JK flipflop yet in the strictest sense, see further."

0"Note: Just like in real life, due to initial randomization of the states, the"

0"The above is useful but is not a truly perfect edge-triggered JK flip-flop"
0"however. To be perfect, it should ONLY be affected by the state of the inputs"
0"at the time the positive edge happens. But here you can try the following:"
0"Set its state to off first and turn all three inputs off. Now turn J on and"
0"then off again (without touching the clock). Now your inputs are still all"
0"off. Since J and K are off, if you now enable to clock, a perfect JK"
0"flip-flop should not turn on. But now enable to clock on the above one, and"
0"observe what happens: it goes on anyway, because turning the J off and on"
0"again managed to change the state of the first latch. The D-flip-flop did not"
0"suffer from this problem, because the D was wired in such a way that it"
0"always actively provides either a set or a reset to the inputs. But the extra"
0"freedom of the JK flip-flop introduces this bad behavior."

0"For example, when making a T flip-flop from the above by wiring J and K"

0"them first unless you already know what flip-flops do and how they work."

0"# Flip-flops from NAND gates only"

0"The NAND gate is a universal gate so any circuit can be made from only NAND."
0"In the flip-flops tutorial we created perfect flip-flops from pure logic"
0"gates, but it was a mix of different gates. In practice, it may be cheaper to"
0"create circuits from only a single gate, the NAND gate. This argument"
0"probably does not hold true today, where you can make any gates from any"
0"transistors you want on the surfaces of chips, but the flip-flops from NAND"
0"logic only are actually still quite cheap and elegant compared to the ones"
0"from the previous tutorial, and often the canonical circuits, so the chapters"
0"below are worth it for that."

0"We could do something similar with NOR-only logic, in most circuits you can"
0"keep all wiring the same and replace all NANDs with NORs and that will often"
0"result in the same flip-flop except with active-low inputs and outputs, and"
0"negative edge-triggered clock. But NAND is chosen in this tutorial."

0"# NAND latches"

0"In the previous tutorial we saw the NOR latch. Now let's present the NAND"
0"latch, which acts the same, except its inputs are active-low (so both"
0"switches off is now the invalid combination, and you must set both switches"
0"on to make it remember state). NOTE: if you saw this latch flicker when just"
0"loading the circuit, that's normal, initially a flip-flop is in a bistable"
0"state and takes time to settle to a random state, this is emulated when we"
0"are in 'electron' mode, in real life this happens in nanoseconds."

0"Please look carefully at the wiring above: The arrows in the diagonal wires"
0"are in the opposite direction as they were in the NOR latches above, with as"
0"only reason to have the Q and Q' in more desirable positions in the circuits"
0"below that use this same core."

0"To try it out more intuitivily with active-high input, here it is with the"
0"inputs inverted at the cost of two extra NANDs:"

0"Note that most other circuits below will all be nicely active-high while"
0"using the first active-low latch, because we'll be using NAND gates at the"
0"input of this latch as well, which will invert the inputs making them"
0"effectively active-high."

0"The JK latch can also be made with 4 NAND gates. Comparing this to the"
0"earlier JK latch (from ANDs and NORs): this is like using its SR latch with"
0"NAND instead of NOR so their inputs become active-low and replacing the input"
0"ANDs with NANDs to make them this active-low. The loop back logic is replaced"
0"with an assymetrical variant, this version works best in both electron and"
0"immediate mode."

0"# gated NAND latches"

0"A relay is a controlled switch, originally working electromechanically (but"
0"optical versions exist): It has is a coil and a mechanical switch. When you"
0"send current through the coil, it becomes magnetic and attracts the switch."
0"The switch, due to that, moves to close a contact. This makes a connection"
0"between two terminal wires available at the relay. The magnetic (or optical)"
0"action ensures there is no electrical contact between the electric circuit"
0"used to control the coil and the electric circuit that goes through the"
0"switch. This isolation is very useful because it allows for example to"
0"control a high power circuit safely with a low power electronic switch."

0"Since they are controlled switches, relays can also be used to make logic"
0"circuits. The relay described above was a simple controlled switch that was"
0"open or closed, and that is called an SPST relay. You can also make the"
0"switch connect to a different contact in both of its states. Then you have a"
0"SPDT relay. You can also make the magnet control two (or more) independent"
0"switches. That gives a DPST or DPDT relay, or 4PDT etc... The diagram above"
0"is a DPDT relay."

0"# Important note about the simulation!"

0"Relays actually require physical things that LogicEmu cannot simulate, but"
0"we use the following workarounds to fix that:"

0"- the decoupling: Real relays physically decouple the 'coil' input from the"
0"  switch, magnetically or optically. Here we'll just implement it as"
0"  connected switches instead. It has no real effect on the logic gates we"
0"  make from the relays and we'll hide them in ICs anyway."

0"- bi-directional wires: Relays are simple controlled switches that don't"
0"  care which direction current flows. However, in the simulation everything"
0"  is always uni-directional, like diodes. The workaround is: for many relays"
0"  defined below as IC templates, we make two versions: one for one"
0"  direction, and another for the reversed direction (having the relay 180"
0"  degrees rotated)."

0"- tri-state logic: The open state of the relay is 'high impedance' rather"
0"  than 'zero' or 'one', a third state that exists in real life but is not"
0"  simulated in logicemu. However, as a workaround logicemu provides the 'z'"
0"  part, representing a tri-state buffer, and the relays are designed with"
0"  those. See the help for more information about this, but the gist is:"
0"  multiple z's can be connected to the same output wire, and a high signal"
0"  passing through any of them will be applied to the output wire."

0"- electrically closed circuits: In real life, the relay's coil is activated"
0"  with current, which requires two endpoints of the coil connected to a"
0"  wire. In this simulation, voltage/current sources are not present since"
0"  they are implicit. There is no workaround needed for this, Just remember"
0"  in real life there is one more wire and it needs to be a voltage"
0"  difference to get current flowing to operate the coil."

0"# IC Templates"

0"All relays are defined as IC templates below, so their full form is visible"
0"here, and further down their compact IC versions will be used. The naming of"
0"IC's chosen here is a vertical number (at capital I in the templates, at"
0"small i in the usages) The first digit is the amount of inputs (other than"
0"the coil), the second is the amount of outputs. So for example i12 is a relay"
0"with 1 input (plus additionally the coil input) and 2 outputs, in other words"
0"an 'SPDT' relay. And i21 is that same relay flipped around (the workdaround"
0"described above)."

s..>z....>l

0"The SPST (NO) relay (single pole, single throw, normally open) is a simple"
0"controlled switch. The top input is the coil input. The left input is the"
0"input to the switch being controlled and the right is the switches output. In"
0"real life, this relay has 4 terminals instead of 3 since you need two wires"
0"to send current through the coil. But as described above, this simulation"
0"makes that implicit."

0"It may seem as if the above relay is basically just an AND gate of the two"
0"switches, and maybe in the limited simulation here it is, but in practice"
0"there's a big difference between the top input, and the other two terminals"
0"which can connect any two things in any direction at any voltage, so mentally"
0"treating it that way helps to understand real relays and appreciate the below"
0"circuits better."


0"## SPST (NC) relay"

0"The SPDT relay (single pole, double throw) is very similar to the SPST relay,"
0"except the switch will also connect to a contact when in the 'off' position"
0"of the SPST relay. It is in fact an NO and an NC SPST with shared coil."

0"So now the coil will connect the common contact to either one, or the other,"
0"contact on the other side. It acts like a MUX or a DEMUX (depending on which"
0"side you use as input)"

0"Remember that we need to define two IC's here because the simulation requires"

0"# Making logic gates from relays"

0"To make logic gates from relays, we control the coils (the top inputs) with"
0"the gate input signals. The inputs from the left are passing through the"
0"constant '1' from the left. Because when making logic gates with relays, the"
0"goal is actually to open/close a switch network made from all the relays,"
0"controlled by their coils."

0"So in the circuits below, usually the gate inputs are at the top and the"
0"outputs to the right."

0"The minimal possible relay type is used everywhere below. In real life, if"
0"you want to make such gates from a bunch of relays, it's likely you got a"
0"bunch of relays of all the same type, That's usually fine, almost all the"
0"below circuits can be trivially be replaced with only SPDT relays or only"
0"DPDT relays. If you have only SPDT's, DPDT can be made from two of them. If"
0"you have only DPDT's, an SPDT can be made by not using some inputs/outputs."
0"If you have only SPST (NO) relays, many gates below are not easily"
0"implementable. You can make an SPDT from two SPST's plus an invertor so you"
0"then need a way to make that invertor, or use a normally open (NO) and a"
0"normally closed (NC) SPST if you have both types."

0"# Other Contraptions"

0"Above were all single logic gates. Now follow more complex contraptions."

0"## Half adder"

0"A half adder is an AND gate and a XOR gate. With two DPDT relays, both"
0"gates according to the principles from above can be combined. The XOR"
0"wires going in the other side looks awkward but it's needed because"
0"the XOR needs the second relay mirrored, the AND does not."

0"The first relay acts as an inverter for the first switch. So it's only the"
0"second relay that is the essense of the latch. The set switch enables its"
0"coil, and makes it go on thanks to the power from the inverted R input. It"
0"then stays on thanks to the loop back of its output to its own coil. When"
0"pressing the reset switch, since it's inverted this disables the power input"
0"to the core relay, and turns off the latch. The main relay is a DPDT, so it's"
0"possible to use the second circuit for the external outputs (rather than"
0"sharing the output that drives its coil), including an inverted Q'."


0"In real life, it is also possible to let the coil of the main relay be"
0"connected to the ground through the reset relay and to the positive voltage"
0"through this relay itself. Then resetting happens by disconnecting it from"
0"the ground. But we cannot simulate it here since the simulation doesn't have"
0"two terminals for the coil and no way to distinguish the disconnected and"
0"ground states."

0"the 4 switches on the left. E.g. to make an AND gate, set the top switch on"
0"and the other three off. To make an OR gate, turn the bottom switch off and"
0"the other 3 on. So that's yet another way to make logic gates with relays."
